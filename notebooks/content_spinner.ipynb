      " `` Underground Education '' does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective , as is perhaps implied by the title . But rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past . Some of the historical figures are famous , such as George Washington and Cleopatra .

      " I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price . I expected it to get me through that winter only . I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years , heat in fall/winter and fan in summer . It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter . The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose . Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated . The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately . I 'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough . I just bought two more , my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails . A good , solid product for a very good price \n",
