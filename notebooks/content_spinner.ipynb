I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd 's . I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers . When considering this bose system , this MUST be taken into account . First off , this system is expensive . For just under 1000 dollars ( does n't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g ? ) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers , the subwoofer unit , and speaker cable . At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver , but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget . Bose includes 3 colors ( white , silver , black ) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit ( a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not ) . What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness . For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver . Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through , without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store . Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install . Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system . The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver ( an Onkyo ) and not related at all with the speakers . Since I do run this through my computer ( presently a laptop ) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver , but when that was all said and done , I was extremely please with the system . With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges . My test soundtracks included : Gladiator , Matrix ( II or III ) , Snatch , and music tracks ranging from techno , rock , classical , and alternative . Everything sounded great with enough low , high , and midrange response . The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites . I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers were n't drowning out the voices . That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there . All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs ( though draining my bank account ) and providing me with great surround sound.Good : Great range and volume of sound . Easy set-up . Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically . No interference or feedback.Bad : Subwoofer awkward , no dedicated center channel , pricey , no included receiver.For their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system .
